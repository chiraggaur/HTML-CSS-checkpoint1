              <p> Test match between England and South Africa got under way at the Oval, a ground in south London.<br> 

                It had been delayed for 48 hours, first by the weather and then, of course, by the news from Balmoral Castle. 
  
                Before the match there was an immaculately observed minute's silence, followed by a lustily sung version of “God 
  
                Save the King” and a lengthy round of applause.
